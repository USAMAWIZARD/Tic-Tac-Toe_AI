## Tic Tac Toe Ai (MinMax Algorithm)
Applied MinMax Ai algorithm to Sove Tic Tac Toe 
The maximin value is the highest value that the player can be sure to get without knowing the actions of the other players; equivalently, it is the lowest value the other players can force the player to receive when they know the player's action. Its formal definition is:

### What is Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.

### How To Play
Tic-tac-toe, also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os is a game for two people that only requires pencil and paper, although you can also use a board with tokens.
The board (which can be a drawing on a paper or other place) consists of a square that is crossed by two vertical and two horizontal lines, so in total there are three small squares left in the top line, another 3 in the center line and 3 more in the bottom line.
Each player takes turns drawing a cross or a circle in a square (or placing tokens of different shapes or colors) The winner is the one who manages to place three equal pieces in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
